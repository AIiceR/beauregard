        <p>
          In late 2020 I was working as a customer service advisor for a
          multinational online commerce company
          <a href="https://twitter.com/didbezos" target="_blank"
            >(yes, the one you're thinking of).</a
          >
          I have never hated a job as much in my entire life. Anxiously
          committed to Covid restrictions, I became a hermit: I slept, worked
          and ate in the same room, and the only time that I left the house was
          to go to the supermarket or to go for a beautiful but quite depressing
          walk along the river Panke. In December I realised that if I didn't
          have something else to focus on- something that wasn't work, the
          internet, or my feelings about Covid- I was going to go stir crazy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to get a cat. I had always wanted one- we had cats when I
          was a kid, and I've always loved them, grabbing any opportunity to
          catsit for friends. It seemed as if Covid was the perfect excuse. Many
          of the Tierhomes in Berlin require potential adoptees to have access
          to outdoor space, which I wasnot able to offer, so I started to look
          elsewhere. I found
          <a href="https://www.resqstrays.com/" target="_blank"> a charity</a>
          who rehome street cats from Cyprus, Greece, Albania and the UAE. They
          sent me some photos, and eventually they sent me a photo of a dorky-
          looking 4 year old Tuxedo rescue cat from Dubai. His name was Bobo. I
          fell in love, and our journey began.
